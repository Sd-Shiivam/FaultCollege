# Vulnerable Web Project

This project is a Django-based web application that aims to provide developers with a hands-on experience in identifying and mitigating the top 10 web vulnerabilities. By solving a series of challenges, developers can enhance their understanding of these vulnerabilities and learn how to secure their own applications effectively.


## Installation

To get started with the Vulnerable Web Project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository by running the following command in your terminal:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Sd-Shiivam/FaultCollege.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd FaultCollege
    ```

3. Install the project dependencies:
    ```

```
python manage.py runserver
```

Once the server is running, you can access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Challenges

This project presents a series of interconnected challenges that simulate real-world web vulnerabilities. Each challenge builds upon the previous one, creating a chain of vulnerabilities. To progress to the next challenge, you must successfully identify and exploit the current vulnerability. It is recommended to review the source code to gain a deeper understanding of each challenge.
